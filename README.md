The following is a Hand Tracking Project whose goal is to:

  Be able to create landmarks in important hand regions (ie. Knuckle, thumb, index etc.)
  
  Draw connections to landmarks to create an artifical skeleton of landmarks it is tracking
  
  Create a list to pinpoint when a particular landmark is in a particular pixel in the frame
  
  Finally implement it as a Module to be able to reuse the code for larger projects
